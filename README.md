# rt-inf

Next steps here:

1. Test `pathfinder` in `epinowcast`
2. Implement `laplace` in `epinowcast`
3. Compare `pathfinder` and `laplace` in `epinowcast` to `sampling`
4. Port over simplified version from [adrian-lison/generative-nowcasting-study](https://github.com/adrian-lison/generative-nowcasting-study)
5. More custom comparison using above simplified version
6. Expand to more sophisticated or large version of model enabled by approximate methods
7. Implement simplified model in `TMB`
8. Compare marginal Laplace and integrated nested Laplace to other inference methods. Also `tmbstan`
